## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.
I made an [exclusive repository](https://github.com/Eric-Philippe/Advent-Of-Code-2022) for the past one because I tried to make a challenge (Each day a new language).
This year I will just try to not overcomplicate things and just have fun, while completing the previous years.

## How the repository is organized

On the `root` directory you will find two shell scripts:

- `new_day.sh`: This script will create a new subdirectory for the day and year you want to add. Like this it will automatically create the `input.txt` file and the `main.py` using the `template.py` file where you can find the template I use for each day.
- `run_all.sh`: This script will run all the days from a year you will specify in the CLI. It will run the `main.py` file in each subdirectory and print the result.

_Feel free to consult the `template.py` file to see how I structure my code, and to use the shell scripts if you want !_

## Python

I feel like Python is the best and easier language for me to solve these challenges. Simply ! (Also after the 2022 editions I just want to stick to one language >:) )
